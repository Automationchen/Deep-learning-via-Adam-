# Deep-learning-via-Adam-

Task:Build a deep-NN in Python to estimate a non-linear function,only Numpy and basic library allowed

CasADi:a automatic differential tool to calculate the gradient.Here is infos: https://web.casadi.org/docs/

Apply Adam Algorithm to minimize the training cost.

We use some methods to improve the training:Mini-batch,data pre-processing ,early stop etc.
